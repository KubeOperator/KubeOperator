## What is KubeOperator?

KubeOperator is an open-source light-weighted Kubernetes distribution that focuses on helping enterprises plan, deploy, and operate production-grade Kubernetes clusters in an offline network environment. It has a graphic Web UI that fasten up the process of software lifecycle in this current rapid cloud age.

## How it works?

KubeOperator uses Terraform to auto-build infrastructure on LaaS platform (vSphere, OpenStack, user can also use their resources, e.g. VMs or On-premise). It also implements automated deployment and allows changing operation through Ansible, supporting Kubernetes clusters a full life-cycle self-defined management from Day 0 planning, Day 1 deployment, to Day 2 operating. KubeOperator really achieves the idea of Kubernetes as a service.

The following image is the whole architecture of KubeOperator:

> Note: KubeOperator passed the [Certified Kubernetes Conformance Program] (https://landscape.cncf.io/selected=kube-operator) provided by CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)

## Technology Advantages

- Easy to Use: Using a visible Web UI that significantly lower down the difficulty of K8s deployment and management, built-in with Webkubectl.
- Offline Support: Continue updating Kubernetes and common components of the offline pack
- Build by demand: Calling cloud platform API, build and deploy Kubernetes cluster in just a click
- Scale by demand: Swiftly scale Kubernetes clusters and improve resources utilization
- Patch by demand: rapid update, patch Kubernetes cluster and being up to date with the community version
- Self Repair: Through rebuilding malfunction node to confirm the usability of the cluster
- Full-Stack Monitoring: Full record of events, monitoring, warning and journaling from node, pod, to cluster
- Multi-AZ Support: Master nodes are distributed in different failure domain to make sure the high usability
- Marketplace: built-in with KubeApps Plus marketplace. Able to deploy and manage common apps quickly
- GPU Support: Support with GPU nodes which help operating high computation applications such as machine learning
